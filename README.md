Wrote for MERN

User can login to application and save games to their backlog.  User can sort games based on time to beat and use the collections to populate a prize wheel to help them decide on a game to play.

Current Features:

    -Login & Reg
    -Edit game list
    -Remove game from list
    -Categorizes games based on completion time
    -Utilize a prize wheel for players to select next played game.

Features WIP:

    -HowLongToBeat API usage
    -Steam API usage

Both APIs currently do not work as intended so will add both once issues have been resolved.
